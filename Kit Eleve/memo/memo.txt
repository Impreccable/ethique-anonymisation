1) What are the necessary preprocessing steps regarding:
a) classes ?
    Encoding

b) categorical features ? 
    OneHotEncoding = get_dummies
    Label Encoding
    Handling Missing Values

c) continuous features ?
    Scaling
    Handling Outliers
    Imputation

2) Confusion matrix:
        [44,  6]
        [ 9, 32]

        TN = 44
        FP = 6
        FN = 9
        TN = 32


a)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed with a Heart disease (false positives) ?    - 6 patients
b)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?         - 9 patients


3) Changing the threshold:
a)What is the precision if we change the threshold to have a 0.95 recall ? -              0.47126436781609193
b) How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?  -     0



4) Choosing an overall metric:
a) If I can compute my test sample probabilities and care more about the positive class, which overall metric should I use to compare classifiers ? - precision, recall, F1
b) And if I only have the class predictions and no probabilities ?                                                                                  - precision, recall, F1
